    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1> <br> 
     <p class="pa">An exoplanet is any planet that exists beyond our solar system. Most of the planets we're familiar with orbit a star, much like the planets in our solar system revolve around the Sun. Similarly, exoplanets typically orbit stars in distant solar systems. These stars can be similar to our Sun, or they might be larger, smaller, hotter, or cooler. The discovery of exoplanets has greatly expanded our understanding of the universe and the diversity of planetary systems that exist.

     Some exoplanets are Earth-like, while others are completely different from anything we've ever seen in our solar system. For example, Kepler-186f, discovered in 2014, is an Earth-sized exoplanet located in the "habitable zone" of its star, which means it could have the right conditions for liquid water. Another famous exoplanet is HD 189733b, a gas giant with scorching temperatures and high winds, known for its deep blue color, caused by silicate particles in its atmosphere, which could create glass-like rain.
    
     While many exoplanets are bound to their stars, there is a special category of exoplanets known as rogue planets, or free-floating planets. These planets do not orbit any star but drift alone through space. <br> <br>Rogue planets likely formed in a planetary system like regular exoplanets but were later ejected due to gravitational interactions or other processes. An example of a possible rogue planet is CFBDSIR 2149-0403, a candidate for a free-floating planet located relatively close to Earth (about 100 light-years away).
    
     To date, scientists have confirmed over 5,600 exoplanets, with more being discovered regularly. These discoveries are made using various techniques, such as the transit method, where scientists observe a planet passing in front of its star, causing a slight dimming in the starâ€™s light, and the radial velocity method, which measures the gravitational wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet.
    
     Despite the vast number of confirmed exoplanets, astronomers believe that there are billions more throughout the universe, many of which remain undiscovered. As technology improves and new telescopes are launched, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, our ability to detect and study these distant worlds will continue to grow, opening up exciting possibilities for learning more about planets beyond our solar system.</p>
